						HPP stands for Hydroelectric power plant ('hydropower plant') which is an electric power plant that uses the movement of falling water to produce energy. Most often water from a dam is used to rotate a turbine with a coupled electric generator driven by the passing water. Recently, there has been a growing interest in building small hydropower plants. Unlike other hydropower plants this type of power generation facility does not need pre-accumulated water, which makes it more environmentally friendly. Now that you are acquainted with this type of hydropower plant, do you know how its turbines operate. They transform the kinetic force of the falling water into mechanical energy. Then a generator turns it into electricity. The highest operating water level (LWWH) is the level of the dam at which the HPP operates optimally. You now know what an HPP is. Many people consider it as one of the safest ways of producing energy.

						The second thing we will talk about are wind turbines. But what are they and how do they work? A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy from the movement of air masses above the earth into electricity. The extraordinary advantages of wind power are that it produces renewable energy. There are two types, based on their axis of rotation. The first one has a vertical axis of rotation. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are quiet, economical, and efficient for household energy production. They operate at a low wind speed and are easier to maintain. They are used where the wind direction changes often. The electric generators are located at the base of the wind turbine. The second type has a horizontal axis of rotation. Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) are used to produce more electricity. They are far more efficient than the vertical axis wind turbines. Features of the Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines are the following:
						<br>
						<br>
						-they are mounted on a tower, that allows having a large and powerful propeller;
						<br>
						<br>
						-the wind turbine is directed in the wind direction;
						<br>
						<br>
						-they use a highly efficient aerodynamic profile, similar to an airplane wing;
						<br>
						<br>
						Small turbines point in the direction of the wind. Larger turbines have a relatively low rotation speed. The propeller blades are rigid which makes them resistant to strong winds. The propeller and the tower are designed to increase efficiency and lower the effect of the turbulence created by the tower. Wind generators are very environmentally friendly, but they are not perfect and do have their problems. An example is that there is a risk of a flock of birds colliding with the installation and breaking it.

						You now know what hydroelectric power plants and wind turbines are. But we kept mentioning the use of turbines in the process of producing electricity. How does such a turbine actually work? The turbine is a rotary engine that extracts energy from the motion of fluid or gasses. Hydroelectric power plants use water turbines that are driven by water pressure, wind turbines use the power of the wind and steam turbines use steam pressure. The kinetic energy of the pressure of the working fluid is converted into rotational motion of the shaft (rotor). Those turbines drive generators which turn that rotation into electrical energy. In fact, almost all types of power plants use turbines. All power plants that burn fuel (coal, oil, natural gas) as well as nuclear and mirror solar plants generate electricity by heating up water (thus turning it into steam) and driving turbines with it. Typically, the turbines consist of one or more paddle wheels mounted on a common shaft. The turbocharger or turbo pump works in a similar way. In those cases, the kinetic energy from the machine shaft is used to compress gas or pump fluid.
